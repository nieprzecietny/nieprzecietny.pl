# LinkHubApp

Minimal Blazor Web App using MatBlazor for Material Design components. Users can define social links, promoted products, partner links, and donation pages. Each user's page features a banner, avatar, title, social icons and a list of links, with a footer saying "Generated with love". Data is served from a simple in-memory .NET backend.

## Running

```bash
dotnet run --project LinkHubApp/LinkHubApp.csproj
```

Then browse to `https://localhost:5001/demo` to see the sample page.
